# claw-drive

Drive-as-user MCP server + CLI for Claude Code. Lets one Claude Code session drive a second fresh Claude Code session end-to-end for dogfooding — multi-turn conversation, async event polling, policy-gated permissions with human-in-the-loop escalation, restart-resilient across caller restarts.

> Status: v0.1.0. Single-user, single-host, local only.

## How it works

- Your **dev session** (Session A, running Claude Code where you're building something) asks claw-drive to spawn a fresh **driven session** (Session B) in another directory.
- Session B is a real `claude -p --input-format=stream-json --output-format=stream-json` subprocess. It runs like a user would — it even uses hooks.
- Every tool call B makes is gated through a PreToolUse hook that talks to claw-drive's runner. Policy rules auto-approve, auto-reject, or escalate to you.
- Events stream to `~/.claw-drive/sessions/<id>/events.jsonl` — MCP `poll_*` tools and `claw-drive tail` both read it.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-claw-drive-design.md` for the full design.

## Install

```bash
git clone <your fork> claw-drive
cd claw-drive
npm install
npm run build
npm link    # exposes `claw-drive` on PATH
```

Runtime deps for the Bash approver: **`jq`** and a Unix-socket-capable **`nc`** (OpenBSD `nc` or nmap `ncat`). Install via your package manager (`apt install jq netcat-openbsd` / `brew install jq nmap`).

## Quick start — from the CLI

```bash
# Start a session with bypass policy
mkdir -p ~/tmp/demo && echo hi > ~/tmp/demo/readme.txt
echo '"bypass"' > /tmp/policy.json
SESS=$(claw-drive start --cwd ~/tmp/demo --policy /tmp/policy.json)

# Drive it
claw-drive send "$SESS" "Read readme.txt and report its contents."
claw-drive tail "$SESS" --follow  # Ctrl-C when you see turn_completed

# Stop
claw-drive stop "$SESS"
```

## Quick start — from a Claude Code MCP client

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "claw-drive": { "command": "claw-drive", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

In your Claude Code session ask:

> Use claw-drive to start a session in `/path/to/project`, send the contents of `scenario.md` as a user turn, and poll until it's done. Surface any pending approvals.

Claude Code calls `start_session`, `send_turn`, `poll_turn`, `resolve_tool_call` via MCP.

## Policy

A policy is either `"bypass"` (no gating) or an object. Rules in order: `auto_approve` wins over `auto_reject`; unmatched calls escalate by default.

```json
{
  "auto_approve": [
    { "tool": "Read" },
    { "tool": "Bash", "bash_command_matches": "^git (status|diff|log|show|branch) " }
  ],
  "auto_reject": [
    { "tool": "Bash", "bash_command_matches": "sudo |rm -rf |git push ", "severity": "high" }
  ],
  "escalate_default": true,
  "decision_timeout_seconds": 300
}
```

On timeout: the `default_action` for escalated calls is `approve` (when `escalate_default: true`) or `reject` (when `escalate_default: false`). The approver script self-times-out 5s before claude's 600s hook ceiling and fails secure (exit 2 / deny).

## MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start_session` | Start a driven session; returns `session_id` |
| `stop_session` | Reap B; keep session dir for inspection |
| `send_turn` | Non-blocking; returns `turn_id` |
| `poll_turn` | Fetch events + status for a turn (optional long-poll) |
| `poll_session` | Tail all events for a session |
| `list_sessions` | List live + orphaned sessions |
| `resolve_tool_call` | Approve/reject a paused tool call; optionally remember as policy |
| `update_policy` | Replace a session's policy |
| `interrupt_turn` | SIGINT B to cancel the current turn |

## CLI

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sessions` | List sessions (live + orphaned) |
| `show <session>` | State + last 20 events |
| `tail <session> [--since N] [--follow]` | Stream events |
| `pending [<session>]` | List awaiting-approval calls |
| `approve <call_id> [--reason R]` | Approve a paused call |
| `reject <call_id> [--reason R]` | Reject a paused call |
| `send <session> "<msg>"` | Send a user turn |
| `start --cwd PATH [--policy FILE] [--brief FILE]` | Start a session |
| `stop <session>` | Reap B |
| `interrupt <session> <turn>` | SIGINT B |
| `policy <session> [--set FILE] [--show]` | View/replace policy |
| `prune [--older-than 24h]` | Remove dead sessions older than cutoff |

## Troubleshooting

### Orphaned sessions

`claw-drive sessions` flags sessions as `orphaned` when the runner pid is dead but state still says running. `claw-drive prune --older-than 1h` cleans them up.

### Stuck on an approval

`claw-drive pending` shows paused calls. `claw-drive approve <call_id>` or `reject <call_id>` unsticks B. If decision times out, the default action fires automatically.

### Missing `jq` / `nc`

The Bash approver requires `jq` and a Unix-socket-capable `nc` (or `ncat`). Install via your package manager. If the approver script exits 2 with `"approver: neither ncat nor nc found on PATH"`, that's the cause.

### Stream-json parse errors in events

If you see `error` events with `"unparseable stream-json line"`, claude's output format may have changed. Re-run `scripts/probe-claude-cli.sh` and update the stream parser accordingly.

## Testing

- `npm run test:unit` — 64 unit tests, no real claude invocation
- `npm run test:integration` — 5 integration tests spawning real claude (cost real tokens)
- `bash scripts/self-dogfood.sh` — end-to-end acceptance smoke
